Setting up a new software project for a small team of developers can be daunting task. Developers will first need to select an appropriate tech stack that suits the needs of the project and its team members. Additionally, the developers will have to come up with an effective strategy that allows them to work collaboratively on the software project and manage their own internal and potentially external ticketing system.

In this learning module, we will provide developers with a suggested software setup and management plan aimed at small teams creating medium-sized projects. The plan will contain a chronological set of steps that developers should follow when setting up a new software project as shown below:

1. Tech Stack Selection
2. Server Setup
3. Repository and Code Management
4. Internal and External Ticketing Management
